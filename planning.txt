read in the data from all lists
    jlpts list
        some words have (), like （終わる） or （感）, deal with these
        some words have ~, deal with these
    jt4u list
        need to translate the romaji into kana
        need to check if the word is written in only kana, and make that a no-kanji word
    list 1 separates with commas, and list 2 separates with semicolon, maybe just for the sake of appearances, we want them to use the same?
combine lists
    combine them after the gather_data step
check lists for duplicate entries
    some duplicates might be written in katakana in one list and in hiragana in the other, check for this
remove duplicate entries



things to check in order to be careful
    i noticed at least one word in list 1 that had no english translation, check for empty sets like this
        but kanji sometimes has empty sets when the word isnt written with kanji but with just kana, this is normal

things i want to see for each word
    i want to see if any other words have the same furigana (like hashi and hashi)
    for each kanji in the word i want a list of other words that have the same kanji
