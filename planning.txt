    jlpts list

    jt4u list
        need to translate the romaji into kana
        need to check if the word is written in only kana, and make that a no-kanji word
    list 1 separates with commas, and list 2 separates with semicolon, maybe just for the sake of matching, we want them to use the same?
combine lists
check lists for duplicate entries
remove duplicate entries

things to check in order to be careful
    check there are any words that are written in katakana in one list that is written in hiragana in the other
    i noticed at least one word that had no english translation, check for empty sets like this
things i want to see for each word
    i want to see if any other words have the same furigana (like hashi and hashi)
    for each kanji in the word i want a list of other words that have the same kanji
